}} The 'United States presidential election of 1900' was the 29th quadrennial
presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 6, 1900. The election was a re-
match of the 1896 race between Republican candidate and incumbent President
William McKinley and his Democratic challenger, William Jennings Bryan. The
Republican Convention chose New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt as McKinley's
running mate, since Vice-President Garret Hobart had died from heart failure in
1899. The return of economic prosperity and recent victory in the
Spanish–American War for control of the Philippines helped McKinley to score a
decisive victory, while Bryan's anti-imperialist stance and continued support
for bimetallism attracted only limited support.

Nominations

Populist Party nomination As the nation's largest third party, the Populists had
made an organizational decision in 1896 to "fuse" with the Democratic Party on
the national level - though the two parties offered different nominees for Vice
President. At the state level, local Populist parties were left at liberty to
proceed as they saw fit. In the Plains states, the Populists fused with the
Democrats, and in some states replaced them entirely. In the South, the
Populists fused with the Republican Party. The end result, though Bryan was
defeated, was the Populists greatly enlarged their representation in Congress
from 10 to 26. In several southern states however the legislature was still
controlled by the Democrats, and they began passing a series of legislation to
eliminate the franchise for black voters, with the intention of undermining a
significant bloc of the Populist vote. The move had its intended consequences,
as in the mid-term election of 1898, Populist representation in the U.S. House
fell to 9, its lowest since the party's founding.

The treatment of Populists by the Democratic Party led to a division in the
Party. On May 17, 1899, Populist Party leaders met in St. Louis and issued an
address calling for a "Middle of the Road" policy, in which the party would
decline future fusion efforts. The statement was primarily aimed at the party's
national chairman, U.S. Senator Marion Butler of North Carolina, <!--[New York
Times, 5/18/1899]-->who had been elected to the Senate through fusion with North
Carolina Republicans, and was already working for the re-nomination of William
J. Bryan by the Populists in 1900. The pro-fusion leaders of the Populists
fought back in early 1900. The first state party known to have split was the
Nebraska party, which divided during its state convention on March 19. <!--[New
York Times, 3/20/1900]-->Both factions appointed delegates to the national
convention, scheduled for Cincinnati. Ultimately, the Fusion Populists decided
to hold a separate national convention when it became apparent that the Ohio
Populists did not favor fusion, and were working to organize a convention which
would not nominate Bryan, but an independent ticket.

The "Fusion" Populist National Convention assembled in a large tent just west of
Sioux Falls, South Dakota on May 9, and unanimously nominated Bryan for the
Presidency. Charles Towne, the leader of the Silver Republican Party, was near
unanimously nominated as his running mate, facing only some weak opposition from
Congressmen John Lentz of Ohio. When Adlai Stevenson won the Democratic Vice
Presidential nomination over Charles Towne, Towne after some time withdrew from
the race, with the Fusion Populists endorsing Stevenson.

Republican Party nomination

Republican candidate: *William McKinley of Ohio, President of the United States

=Candidates gallery= <gallery> Image:William McKinley by Courtney Art Studio,

The 926 delegates to the [[1900 Republican National Convention| Republican
convention]], which met in Philadelphia on June 19–21, renominated William
McKinley by acclamation. Thomas C. Platt, the "boss" of the New York State
Republican Party, did not like Theodore Roosevelt, New York's popular governor,
even though he was a fellow Republican. Roosevelt's efforts to reform New York
politics – including Republican politics – led Platt and other state Republican
leaders to pressure President McKinley to accept Roosevelt as his new vice-
presidential candidate, thus filling the spot left open when Vice-President
Garret Hobart died in 1899. By electing Roosevelt to the vice-presidency, Platt
would remove Roosevelt from New York state politics. Although Roosevelt was
reluctant to accept the vice-presidency, which he regarded as a relatively
trivial and powerless office, his great popularity among most Republican
delegates led McKinley to pick him as his new running mate. Quite unexpectedly,
Roosevelt would be elevated to the presidency in September 1901, when McKinley
was assassinated in Buffalo, New York.

After Admiral George Dewey's return from the Spanish–American War, many
suggested he run for president on the Democratic ticket. However, his candidacy
was plagued by public relations gaffes. Newspapers started attacking him as
naïve after he was quoted as saying the job of president would be easy, since
the chief executive was merely following orders in executing the laws enacted by
Congress, and that he would "execute the laws of Congress as faithfully as I
have always executed the orders of my superiors." Shortly thereafter he admitted
never having voted in a presidential election before. He drew yet more criticism
when he offhandedly (and prophetically) told a newspaper reporter that, "Our
next war will be with
Germany."<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/convention/diary/diaryprint.html

www.nationalreview.com</ref>

Dewey also angered some Protestants by marrying Catholic Mildred McLean Hazen
(the widow of General William Babcock Hazen and daughter of Washington McLean,
owner of [[The Washington Post]]), in November 1899 and giving her the house
that the nation had given him following the war.<ref>[http://elections.harpweek.com/1900/cartoon-1900-

race in mid-May and endorsed William McKinley.

William Jennings Bryan was easily nominated after Dewey withdrew from the race.
Bryan won at the 1900 Democratic National Convention held at Kansas City,
Missouri, on July 4–6, garnering 936 delegate votes. Former Vice-President Adlai
Stevenson was nominated for the office again, beating out David B. Hill and
Charles A. Towne for the nomination.

The Socialist Labor Party found itself divided over the Trade Union Policy as
adopted at the 1896 National Convention, and by the brutal manner in which the
party regulars maintained their influence. Many would leave and join with the
fast growing Social Democratic Party. At their party convention in Indianapolis
Indiana, Eugene V. Debs would be nominated unanimously as their candidate for
the Presidency, the first of his many runs, and nominated Job Harriman as his
running mate.

The American Anti-Imperialist League opposed the annexation of the Philippines.
It hoped to nominate a candidate who would run solely on the issue of anti-
imperialism. However, the one candidate whom had shown any promise, elderly
former Senator John Henderson of Missouri, refused. The Anti-Imperialist Party
National Convention on August 15 divided over whether to nominate Bryan or
introduce a third ticket. After a motion to nominate an Independent ticket
failed, Bryan and Stevenson were declared the nominees.<!--[NYT 8/17/1900]-->

The National Prohibition Party held its 2nd, and ultimately last, National
Convention in the Carnegie Lyceum in New York City, with around 100 delegates
present. The convention nominated Senator Donelson Caffery of Louisiana for
president and Archibald M. Howe, an attorney from Boston Massachusetts, for vice
president. However Donelson, being a staunch Democrat, refused the nomination,
and Howe removed himself soon after. Edward Waldo Emerson was hurriedly
nominated in Donelson's place, but would only appear on the ballot in his native
Massachusetts.

=Other nominations=

The Union Reform Party nominated Seth H. Ellis of Ohio for President, and Samuel
T. Nicholson for Vice President.

The United Christian Party nominated Jonah F.R. Leonard for President, and David
H. Martin for Vice President. Initially, the party had nominated Silas C.
Swallow for President and John G. Woolley for Vice President, but both men
refused, choosing to instead contest the Prohibition Party nomination (of which
Woolley would emerge the victor).

General election

Campaign

The economy was booming in 1900, so the Republican slogan of "Four More Years of
the Full Dinner Pail," combined with victory in the brief Spanish–American War
in 1898, had a powerful electoral appeal. Teddy Roosevelt had become a national
hero fighting in Cuba during the war, and as such he was a popular spokesman for
the Republican ticket. In his speeches he repeatedly argued that the war had
been just and had liberated the Cubans and Filipinos from Spanish
tyranny:<ref>[Brands 1997: 400]</ref>

<blockquote> Four years ago the nation was uneasy because at our very doors an
American island was writhing in hideous agony under a worse than medieval
despotism. We had our Armenia at our threshold. The situation in Cuba had become
such that we could no longer stand quiet and retain one shred of self-respect….
We drew the sword and waged the most righteous and brilliantly successful
foreign war that this generation has seen. </blockquote>

Bryan's campaign was a reprise of his major issue from the 1896 campaign: Free
Silver. It was not as successful in 1900 because prosperity had replaced severe
depression and McKinley claimed credit. Advocates of enlarging the money supply
to raise prices had to admit that a great deal of new gold was flowing into the
world economy, and deflation (i.e. falling prices) was no longer a threat,
Bryan's second major campaign theme attacked McKinley's imperialism; Bryan had
supported the war but opposed the annexation of the Philippines. He said
McKinley had simply replaced a cruel Spanish tyranny with a cruel American one.
Bryan was especially harsh in his criticisms of the American military effort to
suppress a bloody rebellion by Filipino guerillas. This theme won over some
previous opponents, especially "hard money" Germans, former Gold Democrats, and
anti-imperialists such as Andrew Carnegie.

Both candidates repeated their 1896 campaign techniques, with McKinley again
campaigning from the front porch of his home in Canton, Ohio. At the peak of the
campaign, he greeted sixteen delegations and 30,000 cheering supporters in one
day. Meanwhile Bryan took to the rails again, traveling 18,000 miles to hundreds
of rallies across the Midwest and East. This time, he was matched by Theodore
Roosevelt, who campaigned just as energetically in 24 states, covering 21,000
miles by train.

 vote in 1900 was in doubt since they opposed both Bryan's "repudiation" policy
 and overseas "expansion" under McKinley.]] The triumph of the American army and
 navy in the war against Spain was a decisive factor in building Republican
 support. Democrats tried to argue that the war was not over because of the
 insurgency in the Philippines, which became their major issue. A perception
 that the Philippine–American War was coming to an end would be an electoral
 asset for the Republicans, and the McKinley administration stated that there
 were reductions of troops there. Republicans pledged that the fighting in the
 Philippines would die down of its own accord within sixty days of McKinley's
 re-election.<ref>[Miller 1982: 143]; Detroit Evening News, September 7, 1900;
 San Francisco Call, September 8, 21, 1900; Boston Evening Transcript, September
 20, 1900</ref> However, as one lieutenant explained in a letter to his wife,
 "It looks good on paper, but there really has been no reduction of the force
 here. These battalions [being sent home] are made up on men…about to be
 discharged."<ref>[Miller 1982: 148]; Lt. Samuel Powell Lyon to his wife, April
 12, 1900, Carlisle Collection</ref>

In addition, Secretary of War Elihu Root had a report from MacArthur of
September 1900 that he did not release until after the election.<ref>[Miller
1982: 143, 148]</ref> General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. had been in command of the
Philippines for four months, warning Washington that the war was not lessening
and that the end was not even in sight. MacArthur believed that the guerrilla
stage of the war was just beginning and that Filipinos were refining their
techniques through experience. Furthermore, Philippine leader Emilio Aguinaldo's
strategy had popular support. MacArthur wrote:

<blockquote>The success of this unique system of war depends upon almost
complete unity of action of the entire native population. That such unity is a
fact is too obvious to admit of discussion; how it is brought about and
maintained is not so plain. Intimidation has undoubtedly accomplished much to
this end, but fear as the only motive is hardly sufficient to account for the
united and apparently spontaneous action of several millions of people. One
traitor in each town would eventually destroy such a complex organization. It is
more probable that the adhesive principle comes from ethological homogeneity,
which induces men to respond for a time to the appeals of consanguineous
leadership even when such action is opposed to their interests and convictions
of expediency.<ref>[Miller 1982: 150–151]; Literary Digest 21 (1900):
605–606</ref></blockquote>

Nonetheless, the majority of soldiers in the Philippines did not support Bryan.
Any mention of the election of 1900 in the soldiers' letters and diaries
indicated overwhelming support for the Republican ticket of McKinley and
Roosevelt. According to Sergeant Beverly Daley, even the "howling Democrats"
favored McKinley. Private Hambleton wrote, "Of course, there are some boys who
think Bryan is the whole cheese, but they don't say too much."<ref>[Miller 1982:
187]; Letters of Sergeant Beverly Daley, November 16, 1900, Private Hambleton,
March 4, 1900.</ref>

Despite Bryan's energetic efforts, the renewed prosperity under McKinley,
combined with the public's approval of the Spanish–American War, allowed
McKinley to gain a comfortable victory.

Results

It is a matter of considerable importance that Theodore Roosevelt, the vice-
presidential candidate on the Republican ticket, attracted unusual attention in
the campaign, and it has been commonly asserted that he brought a considerable
number of votes to the Republican ticket.

McKinley polled roughly 7,200,000 votes. He carried 28 states with a combined
292 electoral votes (65.32%). He slightly increased his national percentage
(51.60%) with 120,000 more votes than in 1896. This change is reflected in the
gains made in number of counties carried; McKinley had 222 more counties than he
had carried in 1896, thus gaining a slight majority of the total number of
counties making returns in 1900.

Of the 2,729 counties making returns, McKinley won in 1,385 (50.75%) while Bryan
carried 1,340 (49.10%). Two counties (0.07%) were split evenly between McKinley
and Bryan, while two counties (0.07%) in Texas recorded more votes cast for
"Other(s)" than either of the two-party candidates. McKinley had a majority in
1,288 counties while Bryan had a majority in 1,253 counties.

Further examination reveals that changes in counties were even more impressive.
Of the 2,729 counties making returns, 2,286 were identical in these two
elections; 113 changed from Republican to Democratic; and 328 changed from
Democratic to Republican.

A notable feature was the Bryan gains made in the New England and
(Northeastern) Mid-Atlantic sections, with also a slight gain in the East North
Central section.<ref name=pg9>The Presidential Vote, 1896–1932, Edgar E.
Robinson, pg. 9</ref> Bryan even managed to win New York City by almost 30,000
votes when he had lost it by more than 60,000 votes just 4 years
earlier.<ref>The Presidential Vote, 1896–1932, Edgar E. Robinson, pg. 37</ref>
In all other sections, Bryan's vote was less than in 1896, and in the nation
his total vote was 23,000 less than in 1896. The percentage of total was 45.52,
a slight loss. Kentucky, which he carried this time, showed an increase of
17,005. In 16 states, the Democratic vote increased, but in 29 states it was
less than in 1896. Bryan carried only 17 states.
