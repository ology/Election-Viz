The 'United States presidential election of 2012' was the 57th quadrennial
presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. The Democratic
nominee, incumbent President Barack Obama, and his running mate, Vice President
Joe Biden, were re-elected to a second term, defeating the Republican nominee,
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Representative
Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

As the incumbent president, Obama secured the Democratic nomination with no
serious opposition. The Republican Party was more fractured; Mitt Romney was the
presumptive establishment candidate but faced challenges from a number of more
conservative challengers whose popularity each waxed and waned periodically.
Romney effectively secured the nomination by early May. The campaign was marked
by a sharp rise in fundraising, including from new nominally independent Super
PACs. The campaigns focused heavily on domestic concerns, especially the
appropriate response to the Great Recession, the long-term federal budget,
social insurance programs, and the future of healthcare reform.

Obama won 332 electoral votes to Romney's 206 and carried all the states and
districts (among states that allocate electoral votes by district) that he had
won in the 2008 election except North Carolina, Indiana, and Nebraska's 2nd
congressional district.

Eight states (Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah,
and Washington) gained votes due to reapportionment based on the 2010 Census.
Ten states (Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) lost votes. This gave the Democratic
Party a net loss of six electoral votes in states won by Democratic nominees in
the previous three presidential elections, rendering the party a national total
of 242 electoral votes. Conversely, the Republican Party achieved a net gain of
six electoral votes in states won by Republican nominees in the previous three
presidential elections, rendering the Republican Party a national total of 180
electoral votes.

State changes to voter registration and electoral rules In 2011, several state
legislatures passed new voting laws, especially pertaining to voter
identification, with the stated purpose of combating voter fraud; the laws were
attacked, however, by the Democratic Party as attempts to suppress voting among
its supporters and to improve the Republican Party's presidential prospects.
Florida, Georgia, Ohio,<ref></ref> Tennessee, and West Virginia's state
legislatures approved measures to shorten early voting periods. Florida and Iowa
barred all felons from voting. Kansas, South Carolina,<ref></ref> Tennessee,
Texas<ref></ref> and Wisconsin<ref></ref> state legislatures passed laws
requiring voters to have government-issued IDs before they could cast their
ballots. This meant, typically, that people without driver's licenses or
passports had to gain new forms of ID. Obama, the NAACP, and the Democratic
Party fought against many of the new state laws.<ref name="rollingstone"></ref>
Former President Bill Clinton denounced them, saying, "There has never been in
my lifetime, since we got rid of the poll tax and all the Jim Crow burdens on
voting, the determined effort to limit the franchise that we see
today".<ref></ref> He was referring to Jim Crow laws passed in southern states
near the turn of the twentieth century that disfranchised most blacks from
voting and excluded them from the political process for more than six decades.
Clinton said the moves would effectively disfranchise core voter blocs that
trend liberal, including college students, Blacks, and
Latinos.<ref></ref><ref></ref> [[Rolling Stone]] magazine criticized the
American Legislative Exchange Council for lobbying in states to bring about
these laws, to "solve" a problem that does not exist.<ref name="rollingstone"/>
The Obama campaign fought against the Ohio law, pushing for a petition and
statewide referendum to repeal it in time for the 2012 election.<ref></ref>

In addition, the Pennsylvania legislature proposed a plan to change its
representation in the electoral college from the traditional winner-take-all
model to a district-by-district model.<ref></ref> As the governorship and both
houses of its legislature were Republican-controlled, the move was viewed by
some as an attempt to reduce Democratic
chances.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

Nominations

Democratic Party


=Primaries= With an incumbent president running for re-election against token
opposition, the race for the Democratic nomination was largely uneventful. The
nomination process consisted of primaries and caucuses, held by the 50 states,
as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., U.S. Virgin Islands, American
Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Additionally, high-ranking party
members known as superdelegates each received one vote in the convention. A few
of the primary challengers surpassed the president's vote total in individual
counties in several of the seven contested primaries, though none made a
significant impact in the delegate count. Running unopposed everywhere else,
President Obama cemented his status as the Democratic presumptive nominee on
April 3, 2012 by securing the minimum number of pledged delegates needed to
clinch the nomination.<ref>Jackson, David (April 4, 2012)[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/04/this-just-

Republican Party


=Primaries= Candidates with considerable name recognition who entered the race
for the Republican presidential nomination in the early stages of the primary
campaign included Congressman and former Libertarian nominee Ron Paul, former
Governor Tim Pawlenty, who co-chaired John McCain's campaign in 2008, former
Governor Mitt Romney, the runner-up for the nomination in the 2008 cycle, and
former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.

The first debate took place on May 5, 2011 in Greenville, South Carolina, with
businessman Herman Cain, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, Ron Paul, Tim
Pawlenty, and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum participating. Another
debate took place a month later, with Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, former Utah
Governor Jon Huntsman, and Rep. Michele Bachmann participating, and Gary Johnson
excluded. A total of thirteen debates were held before the Iowa caucuses.

The first major event of the campaign was the Ames Straw Poll, which took place
in Iowa on August 13, 2011. Michele Bachmann won the straw poll (this ultimately
proved to be the acme of her campaign).<ref></ref> Pawlenty withdrew from the
race after a poor showing in the straw poll, as did Thaddeus McCotter, the only
candidate among those who qualified for the ballot who was refused entrance into
the debate.<ref></ref>

It became clear at around this point in the nomination process that while Romney
was considered to be the likely nominee by the Republican establishment, a large
segment of the conservative primary electorate found him to be too moderate for
their tastes. As a result, a number of potential "anti-Romney" candidates were
put forward,<ref></ref><ref>Norington, Brad [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/romney-has-money-but-lacks-

last of whom decided to run in August 2011. Perry did poorly in the debates,
however, and Herman Cain and then Newt Gingrich came into the fore in October
and November.

Due to a number of scandals, Cain withdrew just before the end of the year,
after having gotten on the ballot in several states.<ref></ref> At around the
same time, Johnson, who had been able to get into only one other debate,
withdrew in order to seek the Libertarian Party nomination.<ref></ref>

For the first time in modern Republican Party history, three different
candidates won the first three primary contests in January (Iowa, New Hampshire,
and South Carolina).<ref name="Newtwins"></ref> Although Romney had been
expected to win in at least Iowa and New Hampshire, Rick Santorum won Iowa by 34
votes,<ref>[http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-21/rick-santorum-is-

Santorum, who had previously run an essentially one-state campaign in Iowa, was
able to organize a national campaign after his surprising victory in Iowa. He
unexpectedly carried three states in a row on February 7 and overtook Romney in
nationwide opinion polls, becoming the only candidate in the race to
effectively challenge the notion that Romney was the inevitable
nominee.<ref>Madison, Lucy (February 8, 2012) [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57373308-503544/santorum-hopes-to-

state sweep"], CBS News. Retrieved August 27, 2012</ref> However, Romney won
all of the other contests between South Carolina and the Super Tuesday
primaries, and regained his first-place status in nationwide opinion polls by
the end of February.

The Super Tuesday primaries took place on March 6. Romney carried six states,
Santorum carried three, and Gingrich won only in his home state of
Georgia.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/dates/20120306
"Results: March 6, 2012 – Super Tuesday"], CNN. Retrieved July 12, 2012.</ref>
Throughout the rest of March, 266 delegates were allocated in 12 events,
including the territorial contests and the first local conventions that
allocated delegates (Wyoming's county conventions). Santorum won Kansas and
three Southern primaries, but he was unable to make any substantial gain on
Romney, who became a formidable frontrunner after securing more than half of the
delegates allocated in March.

On April 10, Santorum suspended his campaign due to a variety of reasons, such
as a low delegate count, unfavorable polls in his home state of Pennsylvania,
and his daughter's health, leaving Mitt Romney as the undisputed front-runner
for the presidential nomination and allowing Gingrich to claim that he was "the
last conservative standing" in the campaign for the nomination.<ref>Gabriel,

On May 29, after winning the Texas primary, Romney had received a sufficient
number of delegates to clinch the party's nomination with the inclusion of
unpledged delegates. After winning the June 5 primaries in California and
several other states, Romney had received more than enough pledged delegates to
clinch the nomination without counting unpledged delegates, making the June 26
Utah Primary, the last contest of the cycle, purely symbolic. CNN's final
delegate estimate, released on July 27, 2012, put Romney at 1,462 pledged
delegates and 62 unpledged delegates, for a total estimate of 1,524 delegates.
No other candidate had unpledged delegates. The delegate estimates for the other
candidates were Santorum at 261 delegates, Paul at 154, Gingrich at 142,
Bachmann at 1, Huntsman at 1, and all others at 0.<ref

The Presidential Nomination of the Green Party was primarily fought for by two
of its candidates, Jill Stein who was Chair of the Green-Rainbow Party in
Massachusetts, and Roseanne Barr a noted Comedian. While Barr unexpectedly
proved to be a formidable opponent for Stein, her campaign was fatally injured
when she lost the party's California presidential primary. While Stein managed
to comfortably carry the nomination at Baltimore, Barr would seek and later
attain the Peace and Freedom Party's nomination. Cheri Honkala, and anti-poverty
advocate from Pennsylvania, was nominated to be Stein's running-mate. Stein and
Honkala would receive 469,583 votes (0.36% of the National Popular vote).

Initially there was little challenge against Virgil Goode, who had only declared
his intention to run for the nomination in February. At the Party's convention
in Nashville however Darrell Castle, who had been the party's nominee for the
Vice Presidency in 2008, decided to run himself at the urging of a number of the
delegates present, despite his prior promises to both Goode and Robby Wells that
he had no intention of seeking the nomination. Virgil Goode managed to attain
the nomination on the first ballot, just barely attaining a majority of the
vote. Jim Clymer, who up to that time was the Chairman of the Constitution
Party, was named his running mate. Goode and Clymer would receive 122,001 votes
(0.09% of the National Popular vote).

=Justice Party=




Justice candidate: *'[[Rocky Anderson]]', former mayor of Salt Lake City and
founding member of the Justice Party from Utah

The Justice Party nominated its prime founder, former Mayor Rocky Anderson, as
its Presidential nominee in its first election to that office. Luis J.
Rodriguez, a noted poet and novelist, was selected to be his running-mate in the
election. Anderson and Rodriguez would receive 43,011 votes (0.03% of the
National Popular vote).

Financing and advertising The United States presidential election of 2012 broke
new records in financing, fundraising, and negative campaigning. Through grass-
roots campaign contributions, online donations, and Super PACs, Obama and Romney
raised a combined total of more than two billion dollars.<ref></ref> Super PACs
constituted nearly one fourth of the total financing, with most of the total
coming from pro-Romney PACs.<ref></ref> Obama raised $690 million through online
channels, beating his record of $500 million in 2008.<ref></ref> Most of the
advertising in the 2012 presidential campaign was decidedly negative: it was
found that 80% of the ads put out by Obama and 84% of the ads put out by Romney
were negative.<ref>"The hundreds of thousands of television commercials
broadcast by the presidential candidates are lopsidedly negative; this is the
case with 80 percent of those put out by President Barack Obama and 84 percent
of those for Mitt Romney."</ref>

Notable expressions, phrases, and statements <!--
Note: Romnesia redirects here. If you're changing the name of this section
      heading, please fix the redirect Romneisa -->
    * Severely conservative – In a speech he made at the Conservative Political
      Action Conference in February 2012, Romney claimed that he had been a
      "severely conservative Republican governor." Romney's description of his
      record as "severely conservative" was widely criticized by political
      commentators as both rhetorically clumsy and factually inaccurate.<ref>http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-02-
      16/politics/35444438_1_mitt-romney-conservative-governor-david-
      tuerck</ref><ref>http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/mitt-romneys-severe-
      conservatism_652663.html</ref><ref>http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/13/opinion/-
      frum-romney-moves/index.html</ref> Later, the phrase "severely
      conservative" was frequently brought up by Democrats to make fun of
      Romney's willingness to associate himself with the far-right of the
      Republican Party as well as his apparent lack of sincerity while doing so.
    * You didn't build that – A portion of a statement that Obama made in a July
      2012 campaign speech in Roanoke, Virginia. Obama was explaining how
      businesses depend on government-provided infrastructure to succeed, but
      many critics of his remarks claimed that he was underplaying the work of
      entrepreneurs and giving the government credit for individuals' success.
      The Romney campaign immediately jumped on the statement in an effort to
      drive a wedge between Obama and small business owners. A major theme of
      the 2012 Republican National Convention was "We Built It."
    * 47 percent – An expression Romney used at a private campaign fundraising
      event which was secretly recorded and publicly released. At the private
      event, Romney said that 47 percent of the people would vote for Barack
      Obama no matter what Romney said or did because those people "are
      dependent upon government".
    * Binders full of women – A phrase that Romney used in the second
      presidential debate to refer to the long list of female candidates that he
      considered when choosing his cabinet members as Governor of Massachusetts.
    * Romnesia – A term coined by a blogger in April 2011 and used by Obama late
      in the campaign to describe Romney's alleged inability to take
      responsibility for his past statements.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Romney's concession


After the networks called Ohio (the state that was arguably the most critical
for Romney, as no Republican had ever won the election without carrying it) for
Obama at around 11:15 PM EST on Election Day, Romney was at first reluctant to
concede the race, as many counties in Ohio were still outstanding. However,
after Colorado was called for the President, in tandem with Obama's apparent
lead in Florida, Romney acknowledged that he had lost and conceded at around
1:00 AM EST on November 7.

Despite public polling showing Romney behind Obama in the most crucial swing
states, such as Ohio, the Romney campaign said they were genuinely surprised by
the loss, having believed that public polling was oversampling Democrats.<ref
name=Adviser:></ref> The Romney campaign had already set up a transition
website, and had scheduled and purchased a fireworks display to celebrate in
case he won the election.<ref></ref><ref name="Romney campaign spent $25,000 on
fireworks"></ref>

On November 30, 2012, it was revealed that shortly before the election, internal
polling done by the Romney campaign had shown Romney ahead in Colorado and New
Hampshire, tied in Iowa, and within a few points of Obama in Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Ohio.<ref></ref> In addition, the Romney campaign
had assumed that they would win Florida, North Carolina, and
Virginia.<ref></ref> The polls had made Romney and his campaign team so
confident of their victory that Romney did not write a concession speech until
Obama's victory was announced.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Reactions

Foreign leaders reacted with both positive and mixed messages. Most world
leaders congratulated and praised Barack Obama on his re-election victory.
However, Venezuela and some other states had tempered reactions. Pakistan
commented that Romney's defeat had made Pakistan-United States relations safer.
Stock markets fell noticeably after Obama's re-election, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 each declining over two percent the
day after the election.<ref name=WSJ-DOW></ref> The main reason given for the
sharp drop was the potential of an unresolved "fiscal cliff" due to the
continued split control of the House, the Senate, and the White House.

Analysis Combined with the re-elections of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush,
Obama's victory in the 2012 election marked only the second time in American
history that three consecutive presidents achieved re-election (the first time
being the consecutive two-term presidencies of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison,
and James Monroe).<ref name=cnbc110712></ref> This was also the first election
since 1944 in which neither of the major candidates had any military experience.

The 2012 election marked the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt's last two
re-elections in 1940 and 1944 that a Democratic presidential candidate won a
majority of the popular vote in two consecutive elections.<ref></ref> Obama was
also the first president of either party to secure at least 51% of the popular
vote in two elections since Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.<ref
name=bloom010413></ref> Overall, Obama is the third Democratic president to
secure at least 51% of the vote twice, after Andrew Jackson and Franklin D.
Roosevelt.

Obama became the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be re-elected
with unemployment above 7.2%.<ref></ref>

Romney lost his home state of Massachusetts, becoming the first major party
presidential candidate to lose his home state since Democrat Al Gore lost his
home state of Tennessee to Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 election.<ref
name=guard101912></ref> Romney lost his home state by more than 23%, the worst
losing margin for a major party candidate since John Frémont in 1856.<ref
name=smpo111412 /> Even worse than Frémont, Romney failed to win a single county
in his home state.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In addition, since Obama carried Ryan's
home state of Wisconsin, the Romney–Ryan ticket was the first major party ticket
since the 1972 election to have both of its nominees lose their home states.<ref
name=smpo111412></ref>

Gary Johnson's popular vote total set a Libertarian Party record, and his
popular vote percentage is the second-best showing for a Libertarian in a
presidential election, trailing only Ed Clark's in 1980.<ref
