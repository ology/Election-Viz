}} The 'United States presidential election of 1904' was the 30th quadrennial
presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1904. Incumbent President
and Republican candidate Theodore Roosevelt was elected to a full term.
Roosevelt had succeeded to the presidency upon the assassination of William
McKinley. During the election campaign, Republicans emphasized Roosevelt's
success in foreign affairs and his record of firmness against monopolies. The
nominee of the Democratic Party was Alton B. Parker, Chief Judge of the New York
Court of Appeals. The Democrats argued the Roosevelt Presidency was "arbitrary"
and "erratic."
<ref>http://millercenter.org/president/roosevelt/essays/biography/3</ref>

Roosevelt easily defeated Parker, carrying every region in the nation except the
Solid South. He became the first person ever to win election to a term in his
own right after having ascended to the Presidency (from the Vice-Presidency)
upon the death of his predecessor. This feat has since been repeated three more
times - in 1924, 1948 and 1964.

As Republicans convened in Chicago on June 21–23, 1904, President Theodore
Roosevelt's nomination was assured. He had effectively maneuvered throughout
1902 and 1903 to gain control of the party to ensure it. A dump-Roosevelt
movement had centered on the candidacy of conservative Senator Mark Hanna of
Ohio, but Hanna's death in February 1904 had removed this obstacle. Roosevelt's
nomination speech was delivered by former governor Frank S. Black of New York
and seconded by Senator Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana. Roosevelt was nominated
unanimously on the first ballot with 994 votes.

Since conservatives in the Republican Party denounced Theodore Roosevelt as a
radical, they were allowed to choose the vice-presidential candidate. Senator
Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana was the obvious choice, since conservatives
thought highly of him, yet he managed not to offend the party's more progressive
elements. Roosevelt was far from pleased with the idea of Fairbanks for vice-
president. He would have preferred Representative Robert R. Hitt of Illinois,
but he did not consider the vice-presidential nomination worth a fight. With
solid support from New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, Fairbanks was easily
placed on the 1904 Republican ticket in order to appease the Old Guard.

The Republican platform insisted on maintenance of the protective tariff, called
for increased foreign trade, pledged to uphold the gold standard, favored
expansion of the merchant marine, promoted a strong navy, and praised in detail
Roosevelt's foreign and domestic policy.

In 1904, both William Jennings Bryan and former President Grover Cleveland
declined to run for president. Since the two Democratic nominees of the past 20
years did not seek the presidential nomination, Alton B. Parker, a Bourbon
Democrat from New York, emerged as the frontrunner.

Parker was the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals and was respected by
both Democrats and Republicans in his state. On several occasions, the
Republicans paid Parker the honor of running no one against him when he ran for
various political positions. Parker refused to work actively for the nomination,
but did nothing to restrain his conservative supporters, among them the sachems
of Tammany Hall. Former President Grover Cleveland endorsed Parker.

The Democratic Convention that met in St. Louis, Missouri, on July 6–9, 1904,
has been called "one of the most exciting and sensational in the history of the
Democratic Party." The struggle inside the Democratic Party over the nomination
was to prove as contentious as the election itself. Though Parker, out of active
politics for twenty years, had neither enemies nor errors to make him
unavailable, a bitter battle was waged against Parker by the more liberal wing
of the party in the months before the convention.

Despite the fact that Parker had supported Bryan in 1896 and 1900, Bryan hated
him for being a Gold Democrat. Bryan wanted the weakest man nominated, one who
could not take the control of the party away from him. He denounced Judge Parker
as a tool of Wall Street before he was nominated and declared that no self-
respecting Democrat could vote for him.

Inheriting Bryan's support was publisher, now congressman, William Randolph
Hearst of New York. Hearst owned eight newspapers, all of them friendly to
labor, vigorous in their trust-busting activities, fighting the cause of "the
people who worked for a living." Because of this liberalism, Hearst had the
Illinois delegation pledged to him and the promise of several other states.
Although Hearst's newspaper was the only major publication in the East to
support William Jennings Bryan and Bimetallism in 1896, he found that his
support for Bryan was not reciprocated. Instead, Bryan seconded the nomination
of Francis Cockrell.


The prospect of having Hearst for a candidate frightened conservative Democrats
so much that they renewed their efforts to get Parker nominated on the first
ballot. Parker received 658 votes on the first roll call, 9 short of the
necessary two-thirds. Before the result could be announced, 21 more votes were
transferred to Parker. As a result, Parker handily won the nomination on the
first ballot with 679 votes to 181 for Hearst and the rest scattered.

After Parker's nomination, Bryan charged that it had been dictated by the trusts
and secured by "crooked and indefensible methods." Bryan also said that labor
had been betrayed in the convention and could look for nothing from the
Democratic Party. Indeed, Parker was one of the judges on the New York Court of
Appeals who declared the eight-hour law unconstitutional.<ref name="www2.cddc">-
http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/archive/debs/works/1904/sp_wkingclss.htm</ref>

Before a vice-president could be nominated, Parker sprang into action when he
learned that the Democratic platform pointedly omitted reference to the monetary
issue. To make his position clear, Parker, after his nomination, informed the
convention by letter that he supported the gold standard. The letter read, "I
regard the gold standard as firmly and irrevocably established and shall act
accordingly if the action of the convention today shall be ratified by the
people. As the platform is silent on the subject, my view should be made known
to the convention, and if it is proved to be unsatisfactory to the majority, I
request you to decline the nomination for me at once, so that another may be
nominated before adjournment."<ref>[http://kdl.kyvl.org/cgi/t/text/text-

the Democratic national convention], p. 277.</ref>

It was the first time a candidate had made such a move. It was an act of daring
that might have lost him the nomination and make him an outcast from the party
he had served and believed in all his life.<ref name="TheyAlso">They Also Ran</ref><ref>[http://kdl.kyvl.org/cgi/t/text/text-

the Democratic national convention], p. 278.</ref>


Former Senator Henry G. Davis of West Virginia was nominated for vice-president;
at 80, he was the oldest major-party candidate ever nominated for national
office. Davis had received the nomination because it was believed he could
deliver his state for the Democrats. Davis had an honorable career in politics
and was also a millionaire mine owner, railroad magnate, and banker.

Parker protested against "the rule of individual caprice," the presidential
"usurpation of authority," and the "aggrandizement of personal power." But his
more positive proposals were so backward-looking, such as his proposal to let
state legislatures and the common law develop a remedy for the trust problem,
that the [[New York World]] characterized the campaign as a struggle of
"conservative and constitutional Democracy against radical and arbitrary
Republicanism."<ref>George Mowry, The Era of Theodore Roosevelt, 1900–1912
(1958), p. 178.</ref>

The Democratic platform called for reduction in government expenditures and a
congressional investigation of the executive departments "already known to teem
with corruption"; condemned monopolies; pledged an end to government contracts
with companies violating antitrust laws; opposed imperialism; insisted upon
independence for the Philippines; and opposed the protective tariff. It favored
strict enforcement of the eight-hour work day; construction of a Panama Canal;
the direct election of senators; statehood for the Western territories; the
extermination of polygamy; reciprocal trade agreements; cuts in the army; and
enforcement of the civil service laws. It condemned the Roosevelt administration
in general as "spasmodic, erratic, sensational, spectacular, and
arbitrary."<ref>William DeGregorio, The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents,
Gramercy 1997</ref>

Socialist Party nomination <gallery> Image:EugeneVictorDebs.png|Union leader
'[[Eugene V. Debs]]' of Indiana </gallery>


The Election of 1904 was the first election in which the Socialist Party
participated.

The Socialist Party of America was a highly factionalized coalition of local
parties based in industrial cities and usually was rooted in ethnic communities,
especially German and Finnish. It also had some support in old Populist rural
and mining areas in the West.

Prominent socialist Eugene V. Debs was nominated for president and Benjamin
Hanford was nominated for vice-president.

General Election

Campaign

The campaigning done by both parties was much less vigorous than it had been in
1896 and 1900. The campaign season was pervaded by goodwill, and it went a long
way toward mending the damage done by the previous class-war elections. This was
due to the fact that Parker and Roosevelt, with the exception of charisma, were
so similar in political outlook.

So close were the two candidates that few differences could be detected. Both
men were for the gold standard; though the Democrats were more outspokenly
against imperialism, both believed in fair treatment for the Filipinos and
eventual liberation; and both believed that labor unions had the same rights
as individuals before the courts. The radicals in the Democratic Party
denounced Parker as a conservative; the conservatives in the Republican Party
denounced Theodore Roosevelt as a radical. People were heard to say that
Parker should have been the Republican nominee, and Roosevelt should have been
the Democratic nominee.

During the campaign, there were a couple of instances in which Roosevelt was
seen as vulnerable. In the first place, Joseph Pulitzer's New York World carried
a full page story about alleged corruption in the Bureau of Corporations.
President Roosevelt admitted certain payments had been made, but denied any
"blackmail." Secondly, in appointing George B. Cortelyou as his campaign
manager, Roosevelt had purposely used his former Secretary of Commerce and
Labor. This was of importance because Cortelyou, knowing the secrets of the
corporations, could extract large contributions from them. The charge created
quite a stir and in later years was proven to be sound. In 1907, it was
disclosed that the insurance companies had contributed rather too heavily to the
Roosevelt campaign. Only a week before the election, Roosevelt himself called E.
H. Harriman, the railroad king, to Washington, D.C., for the purpose of raising
funds to carry New York.<ref name="TheyAlso" /> Roosevelt also begged for money
from Henry Clay Frick, the steel magnate, and his friends. Years later, Frick
admitted that "He got down on his knees to us. We bought the son of a
bitch..."<ref
name="lewrockwell">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north319.html</ref>

Insider money, however, was spent on both candidates. Parker received financial
support from the Morgan banking interests, just as Bourbon Democrat Cleveland
had before him.<ref name="lewrockwell" /> Thomas W. Lawson, the Boston
millionaire, charged that New York state Senator Patrick Henry McCarren, who
brought out Judge Parker for the nomination, was on the pay roll of Standard Oil
as political master mechanic at twenty thousand dollars a year. He also claimed
that Parker was the chosen tool of Standard Oil. Lawson offered Senator McCarren
$100,000 if he would disprove the charge.<ref name="www2.cddc" /> According to
one account, "No denial of the charge was ever made by the Senator." One paper
even referred to McCarren as "the Standard Oil serpent of Brooklyn politics."<ref>http://theboweryboys.blogspot.com/2009/02/patrick-mccarren-how-
politican-became.html</ref>

Results

Theodore Roosevelt won a landslide victory, taking every Northern and Western
state. He also carried the state of Missouri, the first Republican to do so
since 1868. having left the Solid South by voting Republican.]] Roosevelt won
the election by more than 2½ million popular votes. No earlier president had won
by so large a margin. Roosevelt won 56.4% of the popular vote; this percentage,
along with his popular vote margin of 18.8%, was the largest recorded between
James Monroe's uncontested re-election in 1820 and the election of Warren G.
Harding in 1920. Of the 2,754 counties making returns, Roosevelt carried 1,611
(58.50%) and tied with Parker in one county (0.04%). Roosevelt had a majority in
1,538 counties.

Thomas Watson, the Populist candidate, received 117,183 votes and won 9 counties
(0.33%) in his home state of Georgia. Watson had a majority in 5 of those
counties. His vote total was double the Populist's showing in 1900, but less
than one-eighth of the party's support from just 1892.

Parker carried only 1,133 counties (41.14%), a smaller number than any
Democratic candidate during the Fourth Party System except James Cox and Al
Smith in 1920 and 1928, respectively. Parker had a majority in 1,057 counties.
The distribution of the vote by counties revealed the Democratic candidate
weaker than William Jennings Bryan had been in every section of the country
except the South.

The use of racism as a campaign strategy to unseat a popular incumbent president
had numerous weaknesses. Parker's racist campaign found welcome support in the
South, but was not well received elsewhere. He was primarily preaching to the
converted, and the nation's economic prosperity made race a minor variable.<ref

and National Mapping of Election Data, Donald R. Deskins, Jr., Hanes Walton,
Jr., and Sherman C. Puckett, pg. 281</ref>

In 17 states, the Democratic ticket carried not a single county; in 15 others
Parker, had fewer counties than Bryan had carried four years before. Outside of
the former slave states, Parker carried only 84 counties. It is perhaps not
strange that following this overwhelming defeat of Parker there was widespread
discussion of the disappearance of the Democratic Party.<ref name="Presidential
